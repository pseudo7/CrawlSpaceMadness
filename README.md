# CrawlSpaceMadness

## A 3D Psychedelic hand-held Arcade/Survival game created using `Curve Shader` and Unity3D.

### The game is simple and easy to master, you just have to avoid the obstacles and SURVIVE. :laughing:

### The game allows you to create various Levels:
- Using simple Dictionary and Enum structure.
- Adding different tunnel texture offsets.
- Adding curvature changes with time.
- Control the Level times and how it progresses.

## Controls
**Just turn your mobile device left or right to turn the ball along the sides of the tunnel.**
**Easy peasy, lemon squeesy!** :smirk:
